# OpenReports API

The OpenReports API enables uniform reporting of results and findings from policy engines, scanners, or other tooling.

This repository contains the API specification and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

## Concepts

The API provides a `ClusterReport` and its namespaced variant `Report`.

Each `Report` contains a set of `results` and a `summary`. Each `result` contains attributes such as the source policy and rule name, severity, timestamp, and the resource.

## Reference

* [API Reference](./docs/api-docs.md)

## Installing 

Typically the Report API is installed and managed by a [producer](#report-producers). However, if you want to install it independently, there are multiple ways to do so:

### Manifest

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/openreports/reports-api/releases/download/<version>/install.yaml
```

Or install the latest dev manifests from the `main` branch:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreports/reports-api/refs/heads/main/config/install.yaml
```

### Helm

Using OCI:

```sh
helm install oci://ghcr.io/openreports/charts/openreports:<version>
```

Using the repository:

```sh
helm upgrade --install openreports \
     --repo https://openreports.github.io/reports-api \
     openreports
```

## Demonstration

To try out the Report API in your cluster, you can follow the steps bellow:

1. Add Report API CRDs to your cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/openreports/reports-api/releases/download/v0.1.0/install.yaml
```

2. Create a sample policy report resource:

```sh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreports/reports-api/refs/heads/main/samples/sample-cis-k8s.yaml
```

3. View policy report resources:

```sh
kubectl get reports

NAME                          PASS   FAIL   WARN   ERROR   SKIP   AGE
sample-cis-bench-api-server   8      2      0      0       0      4s
```
